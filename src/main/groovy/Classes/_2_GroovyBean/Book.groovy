package Classes._2_GroovyBean

/**
 * GroovyBeans in Groovy are similar to what JavaBeans are in Java, they are classes which expose
 * properties.
 *
 * A GroovyBean however provides the following benefits over a JavaBean:
 * - It implicitly handles the creation of getters and setters for properties
 * - It simplifies access to those properties.
